# **Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves**

Using machine learning technology, the Mildew Detection app was developed for the fictional Farmy & Foods and lets users submit pictures of cherry leaves for examination. It can determine whether a cherry leaf is powdery mildew-infected or healthy, and it offers a report that can be downloaded that summarizes the results.

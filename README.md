# **Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves**

Using machine learning technology, the Mildew Detection app was developed for the fictional Farmy & Foods and lets users submit pictures of cherry leaves for examination. It can determine whether a cherry leaf is powdery mildew-infected or healthy, and it offers a report that can be downloaded that summarizes the results.

## Dataset Content

- We got the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). Next, we came up with a fake user story that demonstrated how predictive analytics could be used in an actual project at work.

- There are about 4,000 photos in the dataset that were shot from the client's crop fields. A fungal disease that plagues many plant species, powdery mildew, is visible on both healthy and diseased cherry leaves in the pictures. One of the best goods in their portfolio is the cherry plantation crop, so the corporation is worried about offering the market a product of inferior quality.

## Business Requirements

Farmy & Foods' cherry plantations have been exhibiting powdery mildew, which is hindering their crop. Checking for powdery mildew on a particular cherry tree is now done by hand. An employee spends around half an hour in each tree, collecting a few leaf samples and visually confirming if the tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. Should powdery mildew be present, the staff member applies a certain substance to eradicate the mold. The application of this chemical takes one minute. Thousands of cherry trees owned by the corporation are spread over several farms around the nation. The time required for the manual process inspection makes this manual procedure unscalable.

The IT team proposed an ML system that uses an image of a leaf tree to instantaneously determine if it is healthy or has powdery mildew in order to save time in this procedure. There is a comparable manual method for identifying pests in other crops, and if this experiment is effective, it may be possible to expand it to all other crops. The dataset consists of a set of photos of cherry leaves that were collected from Farmy & Foods' farms.

- 1. The client wants to carry out a research to visually distinguish between a cherry leaf that has powdery mildew and one that is healthy.
- 2. The clients wants to know if the cherry leaf in the picture is healthy or if it has powdery mildew.
